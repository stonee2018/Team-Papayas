John/ReginaFoodBank (He) mentioned that the current design looks quite good, and likes how it implements previous elements from the current FoodBank website
John/ReginaFoodBank clarified and emphasized the point that the customer that uses the website MORE THAN ONCE should be prioritized rather than the customer that uses the website only once
  (This means make the website more enjoyable and streamline process for the person who already has done the order process once)
   (We decided that this meant that people who have already created an account on the website will have a faster and easier experience)
John/ReginaFoodBank mentioned that more personal information should be included with the creation of an account so that the user did not need to re-input all that information every time
John/ReginaFoodBank also commented that the less information the user would need to re-enter the better
John/ReginaFoodBank told us that while they plan to add more options for boxes (such as lactose free) they have normal, allergy free, and Halal boxes
  (We added options for other types of boxes to our website in response to this)
