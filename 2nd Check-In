Summarized customer notes
Mandatory set of questions that ask the user for specific information such as their address, how many in the family, food restrictions, 
and other necessary questions to help gather information of what they need. By doing so it will allow clients to do the work they need to do. 
This set of questions is a single entry meaning all the users only have to answer it once and they can edit it. 
Also, users will be asked about their household composition. This allows the clients to see if they have food to meet the user demand. 
All related links should be put in the Get Help section.
