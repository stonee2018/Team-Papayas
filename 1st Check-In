Summarized notes from Check-in:
Hope to focus on the consumerâ€™s ease of access and use towards booking
Works with current system of booking (mainly call-based)
While they can only reach so many people in a day instead of declining a person service they get put on a waitlist system (have a system to inform customer of current waitlist)
Most booking details are kept online
