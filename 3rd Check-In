John/ReginaFoodBank (He) mentioned that we should add a selection menu for pickup or delivery service instead of using a mobility troubles list
He mentioned that a drop-down menu that gave the user a selection of pre-made baskets that worked around food related issues would be better than asking the user to input each food problem one at a time
He mentioned that we should add a question for the user's income type (though maybe not a front and centre question, but done later in the process)
He liked the Idea of replacing the current date-month-year selection with a drop-down calendar to make it more streamline for the user
He mentioned that the user should have the capability to be able to move backwards and edit previous answers if needed
He liked the idea of implimenting a sign-in program where if the user had already signed up and inputted the information they could streamline the process straight to the box ordering (with the option to update information)
He like that the Hi-Fi prototype was implemented into the already existing website and was not something completely different
Overall a very informative 10minutes with the client
